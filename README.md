# Collobrative-Music-Making-Machine-II
Virtu: is a wearable step-sequencer with 1D game interface, a music making interface that divides a measure of music into predetermined notes, for collaborative music making. 
The step-sequence interface on screen is controlled by wearable controllers. The three different controller designs resemble jewelry, making the controllers like a natural extension of the body while giving the users the flexibility to dance and make music with collaborators in real time. 
The magic of music is its ability to create a social environment that encourages dancing. Typical music making interfaces keep the users static; Virtu: breaks the user free from this constraint so that they can enjoy both the act of creating and moving to music.
